# uofu-class-catalog-to-ical
Given a class catalog link like [this](https://student.apps.utah.edu/uofu/stu/ClassSchedules/main/1194/class_list.html?subject=CS#), generates an iCal for you to easily visualize when classes are for a specific department. Uses BeautifulSoup for the HTML scraping. The code is in a Jupyter notebook.

## Usage
Alter contents in the first cell and run all cells. The resulting `cs_class_schedules.ics` can then be imported to any calendaring software to visualize the class schedule.
